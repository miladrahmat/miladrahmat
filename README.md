## Hi there! I'm Milad ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying programming at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/), a peer-to-peer software engineering school where Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in low-level programming, problem-solving, and teamwork through hands-on, project-based learning.

Before diving into tech, I worked in customer service and sales â€” an experience that taught me how to communicate clearly, adapt quickly, and stay focused on solving real world problems.
